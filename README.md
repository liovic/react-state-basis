# 📐 REACT-BASIS
### **Formal State-Space Verification & Redundancy Detection for React**

**React-basis** is a real-time architectural auditing engine that treats a React application as a **dynamic system of discrete-time vectors**. Instead of static linting, which only analyzes syntax, Basis monitors the **State Space Topology** of your application to detect mathematical redundancy (collinearity) and synchronization anti-patterns in real-time.

Inspired by the work of **Sheldon Axler** (*"Linear Algebra Done Right"*), Basis aims to enforce a mathematically optimal "Source of Truth" by ensuring your application state forms a **Basis**.

## 🧠 The Philosophy: State as a Vector Space

In a perfectly architected application, every state variable should represent a **unique dimension of information**. 

Mathematically, your state variables $\{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ should form a **Basis** for your application's state space $V$. A Basis must be **linearly independent**. If two variables update in perfect synchronization, they are **collinear** (linearly dependent). This creates:
1.  **Redundant Renders:** Multiple cycles for a single logical change.
2.  **State Desynchronization:** High risk of "impossible states" (e.g., `user` exists but `isLoggedIn` is false).
3.  **Architectural Entropy:** High cognitive load in tracing data causality.

## 🚀 Setup & Integration

To enable the mathematical monitoring of your application, follow these two steps:

### 1. Initialize the Basis Monitor
Wrap your application root (e.g., `main.tsx` or `App.tsx`) with the `BasisProvider`. Setting `debug={true}` enables the real-time diagnostic dashboard and the visual system status monitor.

```tsx
import { BasisProvider } from 'react-basis';

export default function Root() {
  return (
    <BasisProvider debug={true}>
       <App />
    </BasisProvider>
  );
}
```

### 2. Use Drop-in Replacement Imports
Replace your standard React hook imports with `react-basis`. This allows the engine to instrument your state updates without changing your component logic.

```tsx
// ❌ Change this:
// import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

// ✅ To this:
import { useState, useEffect, useMemo, useContext } from 'react-basis';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]); // Automatically vectorized and tracked
}
```

## 🕵️‍♂️ Technical Architecture

Basis utilizes a three-tier instrumentation pipeline to audit your system:

1.  **The Compiler Layer (Babel AST):** A build-time plugin performs static analysis, injecting the **filename** and **variable name** directly into the runtime calls. This transforms an anonymous execution graph into a **structured state map**.
2.  **The Runtime Layer:** Every state transition is intercepted. Basis groups updates occurring within a **16ms window** into a single "System Tick" and maps each variable to a vector in **$\mathbb{R}^{50}$**.
*   **Discrete Signal Mapping:** Each state variable is mapped to a vector in **$\mathbb{R}^{50}$**.
    *   `1` = State transition occurred in this tick.
    *   `0` = State remained stagnant.
3.  **The Analysis Layer:** 
    In pure Linear Algebra, proving independence for $N$ variables requires solving the equation $a_1v_1 + \dots + a_nv_n = 0$ via Gaussian elimination or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Performing $O(n^3)$ matrix operations in a browser runtime for 100+ variables would be computationally prohibitive.

    To maintain real-time performance, Basis uses **Cosine Similarity** as a high-speed heuristic ($O(n)$) to detect **collinearity**:
    It calculates the **Cosine Similarity** ($\cos \theta$) between updates:
    $$ \text{similarity} = \cos(\theta) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\| \|\mathbf{B}\|} $$
    If $\cos(\theta) \approx 1.00$, the variables are collinear, and Basis triggers a redundancy alert.

## 📝 Real-World Demonstration: The Auth Anti-Pattern

Developers often manually sync related states, creating a redundant dimension in the Basis:

### ❌ Redundant Basis (State Bloat)
```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
const [isLogged, setIsLogged] = useState(false);

const onLogin = (userData) => {
  setUser(userData);
  setIsLogged(true); // ⚠️ BASIS ALERT: Always updated in sync with 'user'
};
```
**Engine Analysis:** The Engine calculates that `user` and `isLogged` are perfectly synchronized. It warns you that you are using two dimensions to describe a 1D problem.

### ✅ Orthogonal Basis (Optimal Design)
Basis suggests a **Projection**—transforming a basis vector into a derived value.
```tsx
const [user, setUser] = useState(null); 
const isLogged = useMemo(() => !!user, [user]); // Mathematically clean
```

## 🖥️ Diagnostic Dashboard

Basis provides high-end diagnostic feedback directly in your browser console:

*   **📍 Location Tracking:** Identifies exact files and variable names causing redundancy.
*   **🛠️ Refactor Snippets:** Provides dark-themed code blocks you can copy-paste to fix your state architecture.
*   **📊 System Health Matrix:** Call `printBasisReport()` to see your **Efficiency Score** and the full **Correlation Matrix** of your application.

---

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🕵️‍♂️ Content-Agnostic:** Identifies logical links through temporal synchronization, not data types.
*   **🛡️ Circuit Breaker:** Halts high-frequency state oscillations (Infinite Loops) to protect the browser thread.
*   **💡 Causal Detective:** Tracks causality chains from `useEffect` to `useState` to identify cascading renders.
*   **🔄 Zero Lock-in:** Simply point your imports back to `'react'` in production. Basis is a **Development-time verification infrastructure**.

## 🎓 Mathematical Inspiration

### 📜 The Basis Theorem
According to Axler (*Linear Algebra Done Right, Definition 2.27*):

> A **basis** of $V$ is a list of vectors in $V$ that is **linearly independent** and **spans** $V$.

To satisfy this theorem in the context of application state:

1.  **Linear Independence:** No state variable in the list can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. If a state $v_n$ can be derived from $\{v_1, \dots, v_{n-1}\}$, the list is linearly dependent and contains redundancy.
2.  **Spanning the Space:** The list of state variables must contain enough information to represent every possible configuration of the user interface.

**React-Basis** ensures that your state list is a true Basis by identifying and flagging vectors that fail the test of linear independence.

> *"Linear algebra is the study of linear maps on finite-dimensional vector spaces."*

React-Basis bridges the gap between abstract algebra and UI engineering. By ensuring your application state forms an **Orthogonal Basis**, we build software that is inherently more stable, efficient, and easier to reason about.
